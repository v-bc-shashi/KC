11.) Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

12.) How will you get the current date and time using Java 8 Date and Time API?
ans:         System.out.println("Current Local Date: " + java.time.LocalDate.now());
             //Used LocalDate API to get the date
             System.out.println("Current Local Time: " + java.time.LocalTime.now());
             //Used LocalTime API to get the time
             System.out.println("Current Local Date and Time: " + java.time.LocalDateTime.now());
             //Used LocalDateTime API to get both date and time
