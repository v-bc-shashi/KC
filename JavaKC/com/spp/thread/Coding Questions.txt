1- Write a class ThreadSafeCounter and demonstrate its usage with multiple threads incrementing and decrementing
the counter concurrently.
2- Write a program that counts the frequency of words in a shared ConcurrentHashMap using multiple threads.
   Each thread processes a list of words and updates the frequency in the map. Ensure thread safety
   and demonstrate concurrent updates.
  like: private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> wordFrequencies = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
          List<String> words1 = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "apple", "orange");
          List<String> words2 = Arrays.asList("banana", "apple", "grape", "banana");
          List<String> words3 = Arrays.asList("orange", "grape", "apple", "banana");
